			  	<h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
			  	<p>For most people, buying a home is one of their lives most substantial investments. As a result, selling it is no different. For decades the real estate industry has operated much the same. If you want to sell your home you either know a friend who refers an agent, you find someone online through advertising, respond to a local mailer you received or you call your local brokerage and are assigned an agent. This process can be challenging and awkward for both the home seller and a new agent. Having experienced this ourselves, we wanted to make it better. Born from a passion for both real estate and creating innovative solutions, we designed Cortiam to be a match making service between home sellers and agents. A place where a home seller is empowered to set their terms and then comfortably negotiate with interested real estate agents. Because selling your home on your terms feels right. At Cortiam we also know the struggles many new real estate agents experience in their first few years and wanted to level the playing field. We wanted to provide all agents with access to qualified leads. To give them a place to highlight their skills, potential and winning personality so they can do what they do best, sell homes.</p>
					<p>We hope that Cortiam will help you find your perfect match next time you are looking to sell your home!</p>
					<p>Cheers,</p>
					<p>The Cortiam Team</p>
