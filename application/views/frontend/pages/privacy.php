Any Content or data We collect will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. Please read the following carefully to understand Our views and practices regarding Content, information, and data and how it will be treated.</p>
<p>Through the use of Our Website and any use of the Services each User agrees to the terms provided in Our Privacy Policy regarding the use of their personal Content, information, and data that We collect by their visiting Our Website and using Our Services. Users that feel Our Privacy Policy is unacceptable to them, agree and represent that their only recourse is to discontinue use of the Website and discontinue use of the Services.</p>

<h5 class="mb-0 mt-4">Communications From Cortiam</h5>
<p>To improve Our Services, We may ask Users to complete surveys that We use for research purposes, although Users do not have to respond to them. We may periodically send Users information regarding the Services, updates, promotional emails, special offers, or other information which We think Users may find interesting. In such cases We will use the email address You provided to Us and  which You agree We may send emails to for such purposes.</p>

<h5 class="mb-0 mt-4">Information We May Collect From Users</h5>
<p>Each User agrees that Cortiam may collect the following information about them:  Name, contact information, including email address, phone number, age, gender, IP (Internet Protocol) address, information supplied during the processing of registering with Us, data usage trends, data showing the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, browser information, demographic information, browsing preferences, browsing data, the type of device being used, Website usage information, information regarding any urls used with the Services, data regarding use of Our Services, other information relevant to surveys and/or offers, and any other information We are legally allowed to collect. We require this information to provide Users with better Services.</p>

<h5 class="mb-0 mt-4">Heat Map and Tracking Software</h5>
<p>We may use various types of website tracking software ("Tracking Software")  to track mouse movement, scrolling, and clicks on Our Website in order to better understand Our Users' needs and to optimize the use of Our Services. The most common form of Tracking Software is referred to as a "heat map" and the forms of heat maps include scroll maps, click maps, and movement maps. Heat maps are graphical representations of data where values are depicted by color. Users specifically agree to Our use of Tracking Software and heat maps.</p>
<p>Our Tracking Software may capture screen shots of Users' mouse movements, scrolling, and clicking habits which helps Us understand what Users want, care about, and do on Our Website by visually representing their clicks, taps and scrolling behavior. Some of the reasons why We use heat map software are as follows: to see if Users are reaching important Content or failing to see it, to find and use a page's main links, buttons, opt-ins, and CTAs, to see if Users are getting distracted by non-clickable elements, and to compare usage against mobile, tablet and desktop devices.</p>
<p>We use Tracking Software to help Us better understand Our Users' experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what Users do and don't like, etc.) and this enables Us to build and maintain Our Services with User feedback. This Traffic Software uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on Our Users' behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during Your Website visit and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display Our Website. This Tracking Software stores this information on Our behalf in a pseudonymized User profile. The company We obtained this tracking software from is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on Our behalf.</p>

<h5 class="mb-0 mt-4">Website Analytics</h5>
<p>We use multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners such as Google Analytics to collect information about how You interact with Our Website or mobile applications, including what pages You visit, what site You visited prior to visiting Our Website, how much time You spend on each page, what operating system and web browser You use and network and IP information. We use the information provided by these tools to improve Our Services. These tools place persistent cookies in Your browser to identify You as a unique user the next time You visit Our Website. Each cookie cannot be used by anyone other than the service provider (example: Google for Google Analytics). The information collected from the cookie may be transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which You reside. The information collected is used and shared by these service providers in accordance with their individual privacy policies. You can control the technologies We use by utilizing settings in Your browser or third-party tools.</p>

<h5 class="mb-0 mt-4">Targeted Advertisements</h5>

Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about such activities in order to provide You with advertising based upon Your browsing activities and interests, and to measure advertising effectiveness.
